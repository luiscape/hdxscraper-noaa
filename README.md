## NOAA / NCDC Precipitation Data Collector
This program collects data from NOAA's NCDC and stores in a series of CSV files and in a SQLite database. The collector was designed to work with [ScraperWiki](http://scraperwiki.com/).

The program is written in R and can be executed using the `Makefile` instruction:

```shell
$ make run
```
